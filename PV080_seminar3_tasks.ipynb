    "- then we introduced the **Vernam cipher**, which works with bits instead of letters and uses the XOR operation. This cipher is perfectly secure, but suffers from major limitations that make it impractical to use - the key needs to be as long as the plaintext and can only be used once.\n",
    "- finally, we discussed **stream ciphers**, which try to fix problems of Vernam cipher. They use so-called generators, functions which are used to generate keystream from key. This way, we can a have a short key (e.g. 128 bits), from which we can generate keystream of any length, that is used to encrypt the plaintext using the XOR operation. The generators also have second input, initialisation vector, which is used to ensure that the generated keystream is different each time (recall second issue of Vernam cipher).\n",
