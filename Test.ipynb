    "Implement function ``extract_bits`` that will extract bits from the given integer ``value``. The bits which should be extracted are defined by ``lsb_bit`` (least significant bit), ``msb_bit`` (most significant bit). Least significant bit defined by ``lsb_bit`` should be extracted but bit on ``msb_bit`` position should not be extracted. Positions are counted from 0. Cell also include verification of the implementation - each comparison should be `True` for correct implementation of `extract_bits` function. The function should return the **integer** that consists of extracted bits. E.g. integer value 20 with binary representation ...010100, lsb_bit = 1, msb_bit = 3 will extract two bits (on positions 1, 2) i.e. bits 10 (010|10|0 - extracted bits between ||) are extracted. Hence 2 is returned as integer represented of extracted bits.\n",

One of the CSPRNGs based on the problem of factorization is called Blum-Blum-Shub (BBS). Your second task is to implement this generator. The internal state is updated in each iteration as follows:  $$x_{n+1}=x_{n}^{2}\\bmod M.$$ In each iteration only one least significant bit is generated. But the generator should be able to generate also random byte -- concatenate 8 generated bits to byte that is returned by ``next_byte`` method. The concatenation should result in byte with most significant bit of the byte that was generated first. \n",
